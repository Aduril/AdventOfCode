* AdventOfCode

Here I want to try some (or all?) of the [[https://adventofcode.com][Advent of Code riddles]].

** Installation

If [[https://hex.pm/docs/publish][available in Hex]], the package can be installed
by adding `aoc` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir :session iEx
  def deps do
    [
      {:aoc, "~> 0.1.0"}
    ]
  end
#+END_SRC

Documentation can be generated with [[https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc][ExDoc]] and published on [[https://hexdocs.pm][HexDocs]].
